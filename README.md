Aim: Predicting Titanic Survival with Python

Techniques Used: Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering, Logistic Regression, Model Evaluation, and Optimization

Thrilled to have completed my first project at CodSoft, where I predicted Titanic survival rates using Python. By cleaning data, performing exploratory analysis, and applying logistic regression, I developed a model to predict survival with accuracy. Looking forward to leveraging these skills in future endeavors!
